Winston Churchill to Franklin D. Roosevelt (April 2, 1941)

BRITISH EMBASSY,
WASHINGTON D.C

MESSAGE FROM THE PRIME MINISTER
"Please at once tell the President that in any communication Admiral Leahy may be instructed to make to French Government it would be desirable to make no mention of "permission" being obtained from armistice commission or of escort to be provided for "Dunkerque" as this might give away our source.
It would be sufficient for him to say that information had been received showing that there was the intention to send "Dunkerque" to Toulon for repairs in near future.â€œ
