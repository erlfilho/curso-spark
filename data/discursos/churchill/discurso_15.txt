This telegram must be closely paraphrased before being communicated to anyone. (SG) 
LONDON
Dated May 19, 1941
Rec'd 8 a.m.
Secretary of State,
⁠Washington.
⁠TRIPLE PRIORITY.
1998, May 19, noon. (SECTION THREE)
⁠Three. At present rate in next twelve months we
shall lose four and half million tons of shipping. The
United States by a prodigy of generous constructive
effort will build perhaps three and a half and we
build the other million. Where have we got to then?
Just making time and swimming level with the bank against
the stream. Whereas cooperation of even a third of the
American Navy would save at least one-half of the
tonnage beforehand and give that mastery which alone can
abridge the torment of mankind.
⁠Four. Most grateful to you for your cable."
