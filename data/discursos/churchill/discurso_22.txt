SECRET
You probably know that Lord Halifax will arrive at Annapolis in our new battleship H.M.S. "KING GEORGE V." She cannot, of course, stay more than twenty-four hours. I do not know whether you would be interested to see her. We should be proud to show her to you or to any of your high naval authorities, if you could arrange this. She is due at the entrance to Chesapeake Bay at seven a.m. January 24th. If you will communicate to me any suggestions or wishes, we will do our best to meet them.
