SECRET FOR THE PRESIDENT FROM THE FORMER NAVAL PERSON.
"I expect you are now acquainted with the splendid
offer which General Arnold made to us of one third of
the rapidly expanding capacity for pilot training in
the United States to be filled with pupils from here.
We have made active preparations and the first 5504 young
men are now ready to leave as training, was to have begun
early next month. A second batch of 550 will follow
quickly on their heels. I now understand there are
legal difficulties. I hope, Mr. President, that these
are not serious as it would be very disappointing to
us and would upset our arrangements if there were now
to be delay. General Arnold's offer was an unexpected
and very welcome addition to our training facilities.
Such ready made capacity of aircraft, airfields and
instructors all in balance we could not obtain to the
same extent and in the same time by any other means. It
will greatly accelerate our effort in the air."
